Statistical Learning of Interaction Kernels

PySINDy Folder: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for applying SINDy to Lotka-Volterra, Viral Dynamics & Lorenz System 
PyLearning Dynamics folder is my python port of Ming  Zhong's software for Learning Dynamics for PNAS (https://github.com/mingjzhong/LearningDynamics/tree/master/LearningDynamicsPNAS). 
Specifically, I only look at the 1st order Predator Swarm Model. All MATLAB files in SOD_Evolve, SOD_External, SOD_Learn, SOD_Utils are converted to their python equivalents. 
Rationale: Python is more accessible than MATLAB and I am interested in designing neural networks that incorporate interaction kernels and pairwise distances for autonomous discovery of dynamics.
